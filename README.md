### prepare.R
In my first step I focus on learning how to load up information from fast5
files and plotting this. The rhdf5 library can also be used to manipulate
the fast5 files. In this file you can see what I did to show the example data.

Here some references and doc I used
- (IONiseR) http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IONiseR.html
- (rhdf5) http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rhdf5.html 

### using_poretools_and_minimap2_and_samtools
In this file you can see my steps how to create the *.bam file from the raw
data. I used poretools, minimap2 aligner and samtools.
